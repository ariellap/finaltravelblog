            <p>I wanted to showcase some of my travels that I have documented to be able to share with my friends and family, and also organize it better for myself. So enjoy my personal little travel diary from the perspective of a white, female, Jewish American girl with a gluten free diet. This is my alternative to scrapbooking. I also don't take any of this for granted,  I'm very grateful for all of these places I've been able to visit and experience.

            <p>My travel experience kickstarted when I was 11 years old. I had the chance to go on a youth ambassador trip to Australia with an organization called People to People. It was my first memorable experience of being away from home for a significant amount of time and be halfway across the world at that. Most kids would've been terrified, and sure, I was a little anxious, but it awakened a part of me that I crave. Prior to the pandemic I was on track for my goal of visiting at least 1 new country per year. </p>

            </div>
            <p>I didn't travel that for or without family for years after that, until I was a junior in highschool. My french class was taking a trip to France, and I couldn't pass it up. That was the reason I took French, after all. At the last minute the trip itinerary changed and included 2 nights in Barcelona, and honestly I was indifferent. I had never heard much about it at that point, but it kept my mindset open and with no expectations, and I loved the new cultural experience I had there. </p>
